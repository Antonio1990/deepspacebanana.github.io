<H4>Introduction</H4>
<P>So this is going to be part 1 of a two parter that will cover how I created my <B>Slope Aware Rainy Surface</B> Material Function in UE4. This part is going to cover how to create rainy ripples/patters on surface that are hit directly by rain, so without further ado, lets get started!</P><!--more-->

<H4>Textures</H4>
<P>There are 2 main textures we need to author for this Maerial Function, the first one is an RGB Channel Packed Msk Texture for the droplet,streaks and streak gradient. It is important to author this texture with proper gradient values for the shader to work accurately.</P>
<P>You can grab my Texture <A HREF="{{ site.baseurl }}/{{page.img_path}}/RainPattern_basecolor.tga">here</A></P>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/{{page.img_path}}/Texture_Packing.jpg" width="1024">
<P>In this part, we are priamrily only going to be using the Red Channel with the droplet mask, in part 2 will make use of the other two channels to create the streaking effect</P>

<P>The other texture will be a normal map for the water droplets</P>
<P>Grab the normal texture <A HREF="{{ site.baseurl }}/{{page.img_path}}/RainPattern_normal.tga">here</A></P>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/{{page.img_path}}/Droplet_Normal.jpg" width="200">

<H4>Basic Concept</H4>
<P>The basic idea is to use <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=724ZMiQx200"><B>Alpha Erosion</B></A> on the Pattern in the Red Channel of our channel packed texture, with some additional math to create the ripples</P>

<P>So lets get started, create a new Material Function in UE4 and name it whatever you want, I called mine "MF_Ripples"(this is a temporary function, later in part 2 of this article we will combine what we create in this article) and set up the nodes as shown below</P>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/{{page.img_path}}/nodes_01.png" width="1024">
<P>The Above network creates a basic Alpha Erosion setup, since we are making a material function, I've also setup two Function Inputs to Control <B>Tiling</B> and <B>Rain Speed</B></P>
<xmp>
TextureSample2D.x - (1.0 - frac(time*RainSpeed));
</xmp> 

<P>The above equation gives us a simple period going 0-1, 0-1, we subtract this value from the <B>Red Channel</B> of our Texture, which gives us the Aplha erosion Effect Seen below</P>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/{{page.img_path}}/nodes_01_vis.gif" width="256">

<P>Now we can use some math to create a simple edge mask to that the expanding dot's look like ripples instead. Take the result from the Subtract node and do the following:</P>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/{{page.img_path}}/nodes_02.png" width="1024">
<P>This will result in the edges of the dots getting masked out to give us something that looks like and expanding ripple</P>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/{{page.img_path}}/nodes_02_vis.gif" width="256">

<P>This is pretty good, but the ripples appear and disappear too abruptly, we need to make them fade-in and fade-out over time to make it look more natural. We can achieve this with a little bit of math:</P>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/{{page.img_path}}/nodes_03.png" width="1024">
<P>The Time is multiplied by the <B>RainSpeed</B> variable we made earlier.</P>
<P>What we are doing is multiplying the result from the <B>Edge Mask</B> with a absolute sine-wave i.e without the negative part, it has a period that goes [1,0,1] instead of[1,0,-1,0,1]. We have also remapped the time in this sine-wave so that it goes [0,1,0] in the same time that it takes our alpha erosion Time Function to go from [0-1]. This is visualized in the graph below.</P>
<P>The Equation that we multiply is</P>
<xmp>
abs(sin((Time*RainSpeed)*0.5));
</xmp>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/{{page.img_path}}/Time_Graph.gif" width="256">
<P>This result's in a nice Fade-out of the ripples as they reach their maximum size, as shown below</P>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/{{page.img_path}}/nodes_03_vis.gif" width="256">

<H4>Hiding the Time Loop</H4>
<P>This looks pretty good, but one big issue at the moment is that the rippling isn't continuos, there is hard period where the ripples reset and start, we need to find a way to hide this effect, this can be achieved by creating a Time-Offset version of this current setup and combining the two together:</P>
<P>So copy and past the current node network and place it above so that current one make these small changes marked in the image</P>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/{{page.img_path}}/nodes_04.png" width="1024">
<P style="color:red;">Note:Do not copy and paste the Input variables, just connect the existing ones to the second network of nodes:</P>
<P style="color:red;">Note:I've also used a single time variable for both equations, so that the time offset is universal, and we don't have to repeat it for each time node we use</P>

<P>So we've done two things, first we've offset the UV's by 0.1 so that the second set of ripples aren't in the same spot as our first group.</P>
<P>Next we add a time offset of 0.5, so that these ripples start and end with a 0.5s frequency offset compared to the first network.</P>
<P>You can see the two time frequencies visualized in the graph below</P>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/{{page.img_path}}/Time_Offset.gif" width="256">
<P>Now we can blend between these two sets of ripples, with a Time function that is at exactly the same frequency to hide the abrupt starts and a get seamless ripples.</P>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/{{page.img_path}}/Interp_Nodes.png" width="1024">
<P style="color:red;">Note: Time is multiplied by the <B>RainSpeed Variable.</B></P>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/{{page.img_path}}/nodes_04_v2.png" width="1024">
<P>Now we use this Interpolation TIme Function as the alpha to Lerp between the two sets of ripples, which gives us seamless ripples.</P>

<H4>Ripple Normals</H4>
<P>The Normals for the ripples are starightforwad to set up, we just use the texture coordinates from the two sets of ripples and feed them to two seperate TextureSamples of teh same Normal Texture that I linked earlier, then we blend between these two normals, with the same Time Interpolation Function.</P>

<H4>Wet Surface, Water LookDev, Inputs from Base Materials</H4>
<P>All the basic setups for the ripples are done, now we jsut need to setup ways to get Inputs from a base material(BaseColor,normal,metallic,roughness) so that we can blend in the ripples and wetness.The following sections will cover how to do that.</P>

<H4>BaseColor</H4>
